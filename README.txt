*** The Subtitler ***
by oil_   2017

* Instructions *
1- Launch the _unpatched_ japanese rom with an emulator (there's 3 emulators included that work with the subtitler)
2- Open subtitler.exe
3- Play the game

Tip: By making the emulator window 3x in the options it will fit nicely with the subtitler window.
Note: Using savestates can cause several untranslated lines to appear, but it works well once new dialog happens in the game.
