<h1>mGBA</h1>

<p>mGBA is an emulator for running Game Boy Advance games. It aims to be faster and more accurate than many existing Game Boy Advance emulators, as well as adding features that other emulators lack. It also supports Game Boy and Game Boy Color games.</p>

<h3>Planned features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Networked multiplayer link cable support.</li>
<li>Dolphin/JOY bus link cable support.</li>
<li>M4A audio mixing, for higher quality sound than hardware.</li>
<li>Re-recording support for tool-assist runs.</li>

<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>

<ul>
<li>Windows Vista or newer</li>
<li>OS X 10.7 (Lion)<a href="#osxver"><sup>[3]</sup></a> or newer</li>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>FreeBSD</li>
<li>Nintendo 3DS</li>
<li>Wii</li>
<li>PlayStation Vita</li>
</ul>

<p>Other Unix-like platforms, such as OpenBSD, are known to work as well, but are untested and not fully supported.</p>

<h3>System requirements</h3>

<p>Requirements are minimal. Any computer that can run Windows Vista or newer should be able to handle emulation. Support for OpenGL 1.1 or newer is also required.</p>

<h2>Downloads</h2>

<p>Downloads can be found on the official website, in the <a href="http://mgba.io/downloads.html">Downloads</a> section. The source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>

<p>Controls are configurable in the settings menu. Many game controllers should be automatically mapped by default. The default keyboard controls are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong>: X</li>
<li><strong>B</strong>: Z</li>
<li><strong>L</strong>: A</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>: S</li>
<li><strong>Start</strong>: Enter</li>
<li><strong>Select</strong>: Backspace</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compiling</h2>

<p>Compiling requires using CMake 2.8.11 or newer. GCC and Clang are both known to work to compile mGBA, but Visual Studio 2013 and older are known not to work. Support for Visual Studio 2015 and newer is coming soon. To use CMake to build on a Unix-based system, the recommended commands are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr ..
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>This will build and install mGBA into <code>/usr/bin</code> and <code>/usr/lib</code>. Dependencies that are installed will be automatically detected, and features that are disabled if the dependencies are not found will be shown after running the <code>cmake</code> command after warnings about being unable to find them.</p>

<h4>Windows developer building</h4>

<p>To build on Windows for development, using MSYS2 is recommended. Follow the installation steps found on their <a href="https://msys2.github.io">website</a>. Make sure you're running the 32-bit version ("MinGW-w64 Win32 Shell") and run this additional command (including the braces) to install the needed dependencies (please note that this involves downloading over 500MiB of packages, so it will take a long time):</p>

<pre><code>pacman -Sy mingw-w64-i686-{cmake,ffmpeg,gcc,gdb,imagemagick,libzip,pkg-config,qt5,SDL2}
</code></pre>

<p>Check out the source code by running this command:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba.git
</code></pre>

<p>Then finally build it by running these commands:</p>

<pre><code>cd mgba
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "MSYS Makefiles"
make
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that this build of mGBA for Windows is not suitable for distribution, due to the scattering of DLLs it needs to run, but is perfect for development.</p>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

<p>mGBA has no hard dependencies, however, the following optional dependencies are required for specific features. The features will be disabled if the dependencies can't be found.</p>

<ul>
<li>Qt 5: for the GUI frontend. Qt Multimedia or SDL are required for audio.</li>
<li>SDL: for a more basic frontend and gamepad support in the Qt frontend. SDL 2 is recommended, but 1.2 is supported.</li>
<li>zlib and libpng: for screenshot support and savestate-in-PNG support.</li>
<li>libedit: for command-line debugger support.</li>
<li>ffmpeg or libav: for video recording.</li>
<li>libzip or zlib: for loading ROMs stored in zip files.</li>
<li>ImageMagick: for GIF recording.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both libpng and zlib are included with the emulator, so they do not need to be externally compiled first.</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<p><a name="missing">[1]</a> Currently missing features are</p>

<ul>
<li>OBJ window for modes 3, 4 and 5 (<a href="http://mgba.io/b/5">Bug #5</a>)</li>
<li>Mosaic for transformed OBJs (<a href="http://mgba.io/b/9">Bug #9</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="flashdetect">[2]</a> Flash memory size detection does not work in some cases. These can be configured at runtime, but filing a bug is recommended if such a case is encountered.</p>

<p><a name="osxver">[3]</a> 10.7 is only needed for the Qt port. The SDL port is known to work on 10.6, and may work on older.</p>
